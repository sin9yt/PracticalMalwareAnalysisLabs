# Practical Malware Analysis Labs

This repository is to track my progress of the labs included in the book.

You can buy the book here: [Practical Malware Analysis](http://www.nostarch.com/malware)

It mostly contains different solutions or a brief writeup for each lab exercises in the book. This is only for the purpose of tracking my progress and isn't a solution guide to the labs.
